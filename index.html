    <h1>Reversing an svg path</h1>

    <h3><em>Because canvas doesn't like the even/odd crossing number algorithm</em></h3>

    <p>SVG is a funny thing. You can create arbitrary vector shapes
    by drawing paths, but when it becomes time to get some cutouts
    going on (like, say, to generate the letter 'O') you get to pick
    the algorithm you want to use, and consequently how precise you
    want to be with path direction. SVG supports two algorithms for
    determining whether a point lies inside or outside a path shape,
    which determines whether or not the path the point lies in is
    filled or not.</p>

    <p>1) The "even/odd" crossing number. For a point inside a closed
    shape this draws a virtual line from that point to some arbitrary
    point "infinitely" far away, and then counts how many path lines
    that crosses. If the number is odd, the point is "inside" the
    overall shape and that part of the shape is filled. If it's even,
    it's "outside" the shape and that part of the shape is left alone.</p>

    <p>2) The "non-zero" crossing number. This does the same thing
    but then checks whether the number of paths seen is 0, or some
    non-zero value. If it's non-zero, the point lies inside the path
    shape, and the shape around it gets filled. However, there is an
    exception to that rule opposite-directed subpaths: if you draw a
    clockwise circle, and then put a counter-clockwise smaller circle
    inside of it, both algorithms will consider that a cut-out.</p>

    <p>Canvas2D only supports one algorithm. The non-zero one. This
    is decidedly useless, but we're stuck with it. So what can we do?
    Well, we can find out which algorithm SVG uses, and then flip
    subpaths to make sure that the shape is correct under non-zero
    rules. <a href="reverse.js"><em>All you need is some JavaScript</em></a>
    <sup>(tm)</sup>.
    The following shape is the letter "B" (upside down) from Adobe's
    "Kozuka Mincho Pro" Regular. This is an OpenType font with Type 2
    charstring vector outlines, and these outlines are well designed:
    the outer path is drawn in one direction, and the two cutouts are
    drawn in the opposite direction. So... what happens when we tell
    an SVG file to use the "nonzero" algorithm, and reverse the
    various subpaths?</p>

        </g>
      </svg>
      This shape consists of three subpaths, one large
      shape (clockwise), one small cutout (counter-clockwise)
      and a slighty bigger cutout (counter-clockwise).
    </td><td>
      normalised
      <svg>
        <g transform="scale(0.2)">
          <path id="output2"
                d="M 0 0 Z"
                fill="grey"
                stroke="red"
                style="fill-rull: nonzero;"/>
        </g>
      </svg>
      Here, we've replaced all SVG shortcut commands with their
      their normal command counterparts, and turned all relative
      coordinates into absolute coordinates. This should look
      <em>exactly</em> the same.
    </td><td>
      normalised, reversed
      <svg>
        <g transform="scale(0.2)">
          <path id="output3"
                d="M 0 0 Z"
                fill="grey"
                stroke="purple"
                style="fill-rull: nonzero;"/>
        </g>
      </svg>
      As you can see, reversing the direction uniformly for
      every subpath in the shape does absolutely nothing.
      Which makes sense, because the difference in direction
      is maintained.
    </td></tr></table>

    <p>Using the even/odd algorithm, we can reverse
    as many subpaths as we want, and it won't affect
    the look of the shape:</p>

    <table><tr><td>
      first subpath reversed
      <svg>
        <g transform="scale(0.2)">
          <path id="output4eo"
                d="M 0 0 Z"
                fill="grey"
                stroke="purple"
                style="fill-rull: evenodd;"/>
        </g>
      </svg>
    </td><td>
      second subpath reversed
      <svg>
        <g transform="scale(0.2)">
          <path id="output5eo"
                d="M 0 0 Z"
                fill="grey"
                stroke="purple"/>
        </g>
      </svg>
    </td><td>
      third subpath reversed
      <svg>
        <g transform="scale(0.2)">
          <path id="output6eo"
                d="M 0 0 Z"
                fill="grey"
                stroke="purple"
                style="fill-rull: nonzero;"/>
        </g>
      </svg>
    </td></tr></table>

    <p>For the non-zero algorithm, however, reversals
    matter a great deal:</p>

    <table><tr><td>
      first subpath reversed
      <svg>
        <g transform="scale(0.2)">
          <path id="output4"
                d="M 0 0 Z"
                fill="grey"
                stroke="purple"
                style="fill-rull: nonzero;"/>
        </g>
      </svg>
      When we reverse the direction of the first subpath,
      we have a counter-clockwise big outline, and two
      counter-clockwise cutouts. Since they're all in the
      same direction, the biggest outline determines the fill.
    </td><td>
      second subpath reversed
      <svg>
        <g transform="scale(0.2)">
          <path id="output5"
                d="M 0 0 Z"
                fill="grey"
                stroke="purple"/>
        </g>
      </svg>
      When we reverse one of the cutouts, it no
      longer counts as cutout under nonzero
      algorithm rules.
    </td><td>
      third subpath reversed
      <svg>
        <g transform="scale(0.2)">
          <path id="output6"
                d="M 0 0 Z"
                fill="grey"
                stroke="purple"/>
        </g>
      </svg>
      Of course it doesn't matter which of the
      cutouts we reverse. It's not going to count
      as cut-out.
    </td></tr></table>

    <p>So, when we want to use an SVG image as data
    for drawing on a Canvas2D surface (because
    sometimes you want to rasterize that data for
    blending it with other graphics), we can now look
    at which algorithm the SVG uses, and whether that
    will cause problems when doing straight
    rasterisation to the canvas. If it will, we
    can reverse offending subpaths and make sweet,
    sweet HTML5 love happen anyway.</p>
