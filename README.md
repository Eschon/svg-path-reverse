# An "SVG path to something" converter library!

Right now this is simply some SVG path runner code that creates a (sub)path reverser, but I'll be cleaning it up a little to be a generic "do something with this" (with a built-in SVG to SVG serializer and of course still the normalization and reversal functions).

## This code is in the public domain, except in jurisdictions that do not recognise the public domain, where this code is MIT licensed.
